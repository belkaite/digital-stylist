At the heart of the capsule wardrobe is the art of minimalism.
Instead of having a wardrobe filled with once-worn items, imagine a
curated collection of essential pieces that can be worn repeatedly
and play well together in many stylish combos. Embracing this approach
not only simplifies your daily outfit decisions but also is a way to
sustainability. With a focus on timeless pieces, a capsule wardrobe
is an eco-friendly fashion choice.
